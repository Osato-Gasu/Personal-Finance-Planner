# Governance decisions

## GOV-001 Shared governance pin

- Shared repository: `Osato-Gasu/shared`
- Version: `0.12.20`
- Commit: `10cd1466b10f814f1bd2aab2c5f6ba6465c5899e`
- Snapshot updates are performed only by the shared sync tool.

## GOV-002 Completed TASK history

- Completed TASK files use `git_only`; inactive TASK artifacts are not retained in the current tree.
- TASK-001 remains documented in `docs/bootstrap/` as bootstrap provenance, not as an active governance TASK.

## GOV-003 Zero-active routing

- With no active TASK, `NEXT_ACTION.yml` routes ChatGPT to `docs/ai/handoffs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Product implementation begins only after a new TASK and its handoff are defined and validated.

## GOV-004 Review limit

- Implementation review is limited to three attempts.
- Only the third attempt, after two failures, may defer limited non-required presentation or optional optimization findings.
- A third failure routes to `NEEDS_USER_DECISION` and ends review.
